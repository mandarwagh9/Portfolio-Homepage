#Mandar Wagh's Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio! This website showcases my skills as a software developer through a minimalist design. It features a centered name in bold Apple font, a grid layout showcasing my projects with descriptions, and direct links to GitHub and LinkedIn. The site is optimized for performance and responsiveness, ensuring a smooth user experience. The email button opens Gmail directly. Explore my work and connect with me to discuss collaborations!
